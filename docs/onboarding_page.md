# Onboarding Page for New DUNE DAQ Collaborators

**Who this page is for:** If you're brand new to the DUNE DAQ collaboration, you're in the right place

## Accounts, etc. 

You'll need a few accounts to work with the collaboration. These include:

- A [CERN user account](https://account.cern.ch/account/)

- Access to [CERN's lxplus cluster](https://abpcomputing.web.cern.ch/computing_resources/lxplus/)

- A user account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). _Make sure you can be easily identified by your username, otherwise change it or open a new GitHub account._

- Access to [Slack](https://slack.com)'s [dunescience.slack.com](dunescience.slack.com) workspace. Within the workspace, start by joining these channels:
-- dunedaq-integration: general activity in DUNE DAQ development
-- daq-sw-librarians: the channel where you request membership in [the DUNE-DAQ organization on GitHub](https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ) as well as membership on a particular development team

## "Soft" knowledge

- Documentation for end users of a DUNE DAQ software package can be found in the [official DUNE DAQ documentation page](https://dune-daq-sw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Documentation for developers of a particular DUNE DAQ package can be found in the GitHub Wiki for that package's repo

- The [daqconf Wiki](https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/daqconf/wiki) is special in that it not only provides specific info for daqconf developers but general info for all DUNE DAQ developers

## Next steps
