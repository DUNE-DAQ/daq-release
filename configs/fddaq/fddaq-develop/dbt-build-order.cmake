# "build_order" lists packages in the order you'd want CMake to see
# them (via "add_subdirectory") during a simultaneous build. This is
# due to their dependencies: e.g., you'd want CMake to see
# daq-buildtools first in order to create daq-buildtoolsConfig.cmake
# so "find_package(daq-builtools)" will work for all the other
# packages, and so on. If a new package is introduced into the
# development area, the developer is encouraged to add it to its
# appropriate place in this list
