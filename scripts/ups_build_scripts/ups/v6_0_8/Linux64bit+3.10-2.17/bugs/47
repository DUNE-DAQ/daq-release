Priority: Low
State: Verified

This is what stopped me from continuing the generic install on the linux
servers associated with cmsun1.  The files that would get installed in
/fnal/ups/etc would overwrite the files that were there and that had
SunOS references. Apparently this is ok because these files work in a mixed
platform environment.

I was assuming that they would not work because they were not NULL but platform
specific.  I spent a lot of time last week looking for something about this
in the new ups/upd manual and the only manuals but did not find anything about 
it.  So I am suggesting that this kind of information be added for future
reference.
