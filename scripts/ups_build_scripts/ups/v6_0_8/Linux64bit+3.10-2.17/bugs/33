Priority: Low
State: Unverified

Some platforms produce annoying error messages when sourcing /dev/null.  We
should never output /dev/null, but output the name of a self-deleting file,
even if we need to make a second temporary file, as would be the case for
setup xxx -s.  3 days.  Annoying, but low priority.
