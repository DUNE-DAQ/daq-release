Yes, upd cloneproduct does currently copy everything.  Changing that
iss an item which is on the ups To Do list, but way down at the
bottom.

The problem is, if there are multiple instances sharing the same tar file,
table file, etc. ups doesn't know whether it should remove them when you
do a "ups undeclare -Y".  In practice, it always removes home directories
and tarfiles, and never removes table files; both behaviours are
technically wrong in various circumstances.  Therefore if you cloned
a product without copying, then deleted one, the other one would be
broken.

Design:(?)

  Store a refcounts file in each db directory.  

  For all files/dirs mentioned in the version files in that directory,
  keep a reference count.  When the reference count is zero on an 
  undeclare -[Yy], ask/delete them, too.

  For files with a _upd_overlay flag, refcounts file is a symlink to
  the overlaid product db dir(?)
