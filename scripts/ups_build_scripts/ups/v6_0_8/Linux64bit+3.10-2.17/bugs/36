Priority: Low
State: Unverified

(Un)declares fail if there's an "error" detected, even if it's not relevant
to the declare.  Jerry Guglielmo ran into this with a shared database but
unshared product areas.
15 days.  Very low priority.  This isn't a bug, it's a design feature.  It
would take serious work to fix, and people can rearrange their database and
updconfig file to work around it.
