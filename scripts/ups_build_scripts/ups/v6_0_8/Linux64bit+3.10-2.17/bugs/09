Priority: Low
State: Unverified

To deal with the "sh: Cannot perform a return when not in function mode"
error messages in Bourne shell, we could convert most of the remainder of
the temporary file into a here document.

    cat > /dev/null <<'false'
    ...
    false
    'false'
    <clean-up>

Would need to work out a scheme for not exiting with an unintended error.
