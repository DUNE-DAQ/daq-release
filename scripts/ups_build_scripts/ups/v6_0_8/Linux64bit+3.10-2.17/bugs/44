When one has set up a version of ups with a qualifier like build,
attempts to switch to csh or bash cause some kind of infinite loop:

  doofus> echo $SETUP_UPS
  ups -f ANY -z /usr/users/baisley/ups/db -q build -r
    /usr/products/src4/bm-scratch/ups-v4_5-OSF1+V4 -m ups.table -M ./ups
  doofus> bash
  executing .shrc
  INFORMATIONAL: Product 'ups' (with qualifiers 'build'), has no current
    chain (or may not exist)
