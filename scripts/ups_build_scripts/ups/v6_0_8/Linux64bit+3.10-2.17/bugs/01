Priority: Low
State: Unverified

There are many small dysfunctions with the ups modify command.  When multiple
chains are specified, none of the product files are listed, and an error
message is printed about needing a unique instance, but only after 'quit' is
selected from the menu.  If you instead choose to edit one of the offered
dbconfig files, the unique instance error message won't be displayed, but the
version file will be verified in the pre-modification pass.  For an unchained
instance modify lists the version file, but doesn't allow the table file to be
modified.
