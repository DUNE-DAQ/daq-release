User defined variables in group stanzas get lost.  They should override
those in the common stanza.  Not sure if this is a bug or enhancement.
15 days.  Big important bug.

In a 
  group:
  ..part1..
  common:
  ..part2..
  end:
you can have user defined keywords in part1 or part2 but (apparently)
not both, which is to say that if you put them in part2 the ones
in part1 dissappear.
