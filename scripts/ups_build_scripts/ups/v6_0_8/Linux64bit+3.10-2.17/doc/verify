Things to remember to verify when reading a ups file.
=====================================================

- Better error return when reading invalid keywords,
  e.g reading 'FLAVIR' when 'FLAVOR' was expected.

- Check keyword spelling,
  e.g reading invalid keyword 'COMNEN'.

- Check delimiter in QUALIFIERS,
  e.g if any char not [0,9,a,z,A,Z] and ':' print a warning.
  
- Check that each FLAVOR is followed by a QUALIFIERS.

- Check that no VERSION is specified in a TABLE file.

- Check that all support UPS_ environmentals are actually in
  the file as ${UPS_blaablaa} and not just $UPS_blaablaa.
  This decision to force this was based on time constraints
  of setup.  DjF

- Check for dublicate instances in ups files.
  e.g (FLAVOR=IRIX, QUALIFIERS=a:b) and (FLAVOR=IRIX, QUALIFIERS=b:a)
  is a dublicate.

- Check that a chain file name (<name>.chain) is the same as specifyed
  by chain key (CHAIN=<name>) in the file.
